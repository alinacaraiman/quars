# quars
Robust tools for finance, econometrics, econophysics, and quantitative analysis in rust.

This repository hosts an early MVP (Minimum Viable Product) implementation of a mean‐variance portfolio optimizer in Rust. It is designed to be part of **quars**, a broader library that will focus on finance, econometrics, econophysics, and quantitative analysis.

## Overview

**Key Features (MVP)**

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Fetches or reads historical price data (CSV or placeholder for API).
2. **Portfolio Statistics**  
   - Computes historical returns and a placeholder covariance matrix.
3. **Optimization**  
   - Employs a simple equal‐weighted placeholder solution (demonstration only).
4. **Visualization**  
   - Renders a bar chart of portfolio weights using the `plotters` crate.
